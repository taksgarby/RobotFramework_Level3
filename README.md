# RPA Certification Level 3

The main goals is to learn:

- To automate a process where target systems don't have a GUI
- To use the producer - consumer pattern
- To split the robot code into multipble logical pieces for easier maintainance
- To refactor the robot code constantly to keep it tidy and easy to maintain
- Extract, Transform, Load business data
- To validate data and handle exceptions using work items
- To communitate with HTTP API and handle the responses
- To manage work data in Control Room

Learning highlights:

1. Using WORK ITEMS
A work item contains a payload of JSON-based data and optionally attached files.
There are 2 approach with work items:
(1) - default & more powerful - each step of the process creates output items, with the option of creating multiple items at once.
(2) one work item for each process run is passed between steps and optionally modified at each stage.
